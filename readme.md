## Notes

### Modules
Someone more patient and smarter than I can try and figure out how to get actual modules to work with Paw. This package just uses the minified js directly. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### jsonar

Regarding `jsonar.js`, a modification was needed to help with formatting:
modification on line 213 to remove `;` from `    return `${phpArray};``
